# Data Mining Coding Assignments

## [HW 1 - Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari/Data-Mining-Assignments/tree/main/HW%201%20-%20Data%20Preprocessing)
This assignment is about preprocessing on ```iris-dataset```. I use famous libraries such as ```pandas```, ```scikit-learn```, and ```Matplotlib``` for this purpose.
#### Steps:
1. Handle ```missing values``` and find ```NaN values``` and fill them with proper values or remove them.
2. Convert categorical features to numerical features by Label Encoding and ```One Hot Encoding```.
3. Normalize data by using ```StandardScaler```.
4. Reduce dimension with ```PCA (Principal Component Analysis)```.
5. Visualize data with ```Matplotlib```.

   
## [HW 2 - Classification](https://github.com/arminZolfaghari/Data-Mining-Assignments/tree/main/HW%202%20-%20Classification)
This assignment is about creating a ```neural network``` to classify data in ```make_circles``` dataset and ```fashion_mnist``` dataset.
#### Steps in Part 1 (```make_circles``` dataset):
1. Make 1500 circles.
2. Split train and test dataset.
3. Create a ```neural network```: without activation function, use ```binary_crossentropy``` for loss function, and use ```Adam optimizer```.
4. Create a ```neural network```: with linear activation function, use ```binary_crossentropy``` for loss function, and use ```Adam optimizer```.
5. Create a ```neural network```: with nonlinear activation function, use ```mean_squared_error``` for loss funcion and use ```Adam optimizer```.
6. Create a ```nueral network```:  with nonlinear activation function, use ```binary_crossentropy``` for loss funcion and use manual learning rate instead of Adams.
7. Train the models.
8. Plot loss and accuracy.

#### Steps in Part 2 (```fashion_mnist``` dataset):
